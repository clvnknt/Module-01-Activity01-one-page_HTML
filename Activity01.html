            The protagonist of the series, Ken was once a normal student, however, this all changed when an altercation saw him transformed by Rize Kamishiro, 
            turning him into the one-eyed ghoul. Throughout the series, Ken’s skills evolve drastically, and by the end masters the Rinkaku Kagune to complement his superhuman 
            attributes and regeneration. Fans will recognize Ken in his iconic eyepatch mask which has transcended the show itself.
          </div>
          <div class="col"><img src="tk.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="..."><br><b>Touka Kirishima</b><br>
            Touka is the other focal character in Tokyo Ghoul. A ghoul who has done well to keep her identity under wraps, 
            Touka attends high school while working as a waitress in Anteiku and ultimately becomes a mentor and training partner for Ken after he receives his ghoulish power. 
            Touka is one of the most skilled fighters in the series and a dangerous match for most foes.

          <div class="col"><img src="rk.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="..."><br><b>Rize Kamishiro</b><br>
            One of the more powerful ghouls and the very first viewers meet in the show Rize Kamishiro meets her fate quickly after luring Ken out on a date, 
            where she intended to eat him. The pair then fell victim to a construction incident before she could eat him and to save Ken’s life parts of Rizer were transplanted into him, 
            gifting him some of her power and setting off the rest of the series. While it may have seemed like this was the end for Rize, as fans of the show will know, it wasn’t the case.

          <div class="col"><img src="hn.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="..."><br><b>Hideyoshi Nagachika</b><br>
            Hideyoshi (or Hide for short) is one of Ken’s best friends. His sharp intuition led him to believe Ken was hiding something 
            while he was doing his best to keep his ghoul identity undercover. With this suspicion and following Ken’s disappearance, 
            Hide joins the Anti-Ghoul forces attempting to find Ken himself.
